# Digital Clock

This repository contains the hardware design and firmware for a digital clock.
Files relating to hardware design can be found in the `hardware` directory and relating to firmware can be found in the `software` directory.

## Viewing hardware design
The design was done in KiCAD, so a KiCAD instance will be required to view the files.

## Building firmware
The microcontroller used is Texas Instrument's MSP430G2553, so I suggest using the Launchpad development board. The details regarding the tools needed to build the firmware can be found in the `software/` directory.
